 * `fetchNewPositions()` will extend this internal state with positions that were added since the
 * last `fetchNewPositions()` call.
 *
 * While history is not fully populated, `getOpenPositions()` may not return some of the positions
 * opened in blocks that were not processed yet.  `positionHistoryIsComplete()` should be called to
 * determine if the positions history is still incomplete and one needs to call
 * `fetchPositionHistory()` repeatedly, until the positions history is fully populated.
 *
 * While positions history is incomplete, `fetchPositionHistory()` should be invoked rather
 * frequently.  When it is complete, `fetchPositionHistory()` does nothing and `fetchNewPositions()`
 * can be invoked less frequently.
